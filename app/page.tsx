        <p>
          I&apos;m a full-stack developer mastering Java, JavaScript, React,
          Next.js, Node.js. My passion for data structures equals my caffeine
          addiction. Seeking fresh challenges daily, I transform complexity into
          elegant code. Whether crafting stunning UIs or fine-tuning robust
          systems, it&apos;s all in a day&apos;s work for this coding enthusiast
          who treats coffee as the ultimate fuel for the journey. Who needs
          sleep when there&apos;s always code to write, bugs to debug, and
          coffee to sip?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not busy brewing the perfect cup of coffee, you can find
          me buried under a pile of half-finished projects and coding
          experiments. Developing for fun and caffeine-fueled creativityâ€”because
          who needs sleep when you have endless ideas and espresso?
