        <p>
          I&apos;m a passionate software engineer skilled in Java, JavaScript,
          React, Next.js, and Node.js. My love for data structures matches my
          caffeine addiction. I thrive on daily challenges, transforming
          complexity into efficient code. From creating stunning UIs to
          optimizing backend systems, I constantly innovate and improve. Coding
          is my passion, fueled by coffee and a drive to solve problems, debug
          bugs, and build new features.

        <p>
          When I&apos;m not busy brewing the perfect cup of coffee, you can find
          me buried under a pile of half-finished projects and coding
          experiments. Developing for fun and caffeine-fueled creativityâ€”because
          who needs sleep when you have endless ideas and espresso?
