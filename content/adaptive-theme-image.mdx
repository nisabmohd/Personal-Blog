A few days ago, while I was writing a blog, I had some drawings that I had exported from the well-known website excalidraw, which allows users to draw on canvas. I used the light mode export of the image to include it in my blog. Subsequently, the issue surfaced when I changed my blog website's background to black, nearly erasing the image because the strokes were black on white. The only workaround I could find was to export with a background image that I didn't want. Something that automatically adjusts to the theme is what I really wanted.

I therefore began creating a custom image component that, in essence, extends NextJs Image component or can be extended using HTML img element; however, the source that is supplied to it must accept both light and dark image sources and take theme scheme compatibility into account. Here, I was using Tailwind to switch between light and dark according to the class name.

```tsx {4-9}
import Image from "next/image";
import { ComponentProps } from "react";

type Props = Exclude<ComponentProps<typeof Image>, "src"> & {
  src: {
    light: string;
    dark: string;
  };
};

export default function AdaptiveThemeImage(props: Props) {
  return null;
}
```

This component overrides the src props as the image's dark and light sources, as you can see from the code above, and it directly extends the NextJS `Image` component. The component does not currently return anything. The handy usage is as follows: an image tag takes two different sources and determines which to use based on theme. We'll see the logic behind this later.

```jsx
export function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Heading of blog<h1/>
      <AdaptiveThemeImage
        src={{
            dark: "/images/blog-cover-dark.png",
            light: "/images/blog-cover-light.png",
        }}
        width={800}
        height={400}
        alt="cover-img"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, this component only needs the same props as a standard `Image` component; the only thing that has changed is the `src`. Right now, you can use it anywhere. Now let's look at the logic behind the image rendering part. In other words, it basically returns two image components. When dark mode is activated, the light source's image is hidden, and vice versa. One source is light, and the other is dark. Additionally, this simply toggles the UI depending on the light and dark modules rather than refetching the image each time from source.

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

// ...

export default function AdaptiveThemeImage({
  src,
  className,
  alt = "themed-img",
  width = 600,
  height = 400,
  ...rest
}: Props) {
  return (
    <>
      <Image
        className={cn(className, "dark:hidden block")}
        src={src.light}
        alt={alt}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        {...rest}
      />
      <Image
        className={cn(className, "dark:block hidden")}
        src={src.dark}
        alt={alt}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        {...rest}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  Why not use ternary, one may wonder. However, each time the theme changes, it
  will refetch the image; for this reason, the class name method is preferred.
</Note>
In conclusion, this adaptive theme image component is a small yet effective enhancement.
It retains all the benefits of the standard `Image` tag while providing better reusability
and customization, ensuring images adapt seamlessly to both light and dark themes.
