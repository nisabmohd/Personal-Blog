<Highlight>next-mdx-remote</Highlight> is a library that parses mdx and produces
equivalent HTML. Now a days every blog or documentaion websites are using
<Highlight>MDX</Highlight> as daily driver. The **MDX** is an extension of Markup
language. you can refer https://www.markdownguide.org/ to know more about Markdowns.
The **MDX** is Markdown + JSX. Where you can write your custom components and import
them as well. Also it gives lot of benifits.

**next-mdx-remote** package now supports
**React Server Components (RSC)** which means you can be able
to render MDX at server side and return client a static HTML.

You need to create an new NextJS13 app router project inoder to get started,
To get started with new NextJS13 project you can enter command in terminal

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

I recommend using Typescript as it provides typesafety for project.
Once The project is initiated then install **next-mdx-remote** package by entering command in same terminal.

```bash
npm i next-mdx-remote
```

once the packages are installed run the local server by entering command <Highlight>npm run dev</Highlight>. you can go to localhost:3000 from browser and see NextJS template.

Now just go to page file in app directory and import compileMDX function from <Highlight>next-remote-mdx/rsc</Highlight>

<br />
```tsx:app/page.tsx {}
import {compileMDX} from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

export default async function Home() {
  // Optionally provide a type for your frontmatter object
  const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX<{ title: string }>({
    source: `---
      title: RSC Frontmatter Example
      ---
      # Hello World
      This is from Server Components!
    `,
    options: { parseFrontmatter: true },
  });
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>
      {content}
    </>
  );
}
```
This **compileMDX** function takes an object where source of MDX needs to provided and it return **content** and **frontmatter**
The frontmatter can be used to generate page metadata and content is <Highlight>JSX</Highlight> element which can be directly rendered.
