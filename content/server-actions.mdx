Server Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server.
They can be used in Server and Client Components to handle form submissions
and data mutations in React applications.

<Quote>
A Server Action can be defined with the React <Highlight>use server</Highlight> directive. You can place the directive at the top of an async function to mark the function as a Server Action, or at the top of a separate file to mark all exports of that file as Server Actions.

#### Server components

```tsx showLineNumbers {4-7}
// React server components
export default async ServerComponent(){
  // server action
  async function handleSubmit(){
    'use server'
    // logic to be executed on the server
  }
  return //...
}
```

#### Client components

```js:action.js showLineNumbers
'use server'

export async function createPost(data){
  await db.blog.create(data)
}
```

```jsx:blog.jsx showLineNumbers
'use client'

import {createPost} from '@/action'

export default function NewBlogPage(){
  return <form action={createPost}>...</form>
}
```

### Behaviour

- Server actions can be invoked using the action attribute in a <HTMLTag>form</HTMLTag> element
- Server Actions are not limited to <HTMLTag>form</HTMLTag> and can be invoked from event handlers, <Highlight>useEffect</Highlight>, third-party libraries, and other form elements like <HTMLTag>button</HTMLTag>.
